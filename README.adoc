= *Heap*

        Heap
MAX-Heap	MIN-Heap

- MAX-heap: is a

* - complete binary tree

* - All descendants of a node must be smaller. i.e.
ROOT will be max


- MIN-heap: is a

* - complete binary tree

* - All descendants of a node must be greater. i.e. ROOT will be min

---
*Considerations*

* We are working on MAX-heap now.

* Array- Representation of HEAP: 1-based index

* if node is at index = i

* it's parent will be at = i / 2

* it's left child will be at = 2 * i

* it's right child will be at = 2 * i + 1
